#+title: M5Stack Core 2 demo using plain ESP IDF and the M5Unified library
#+author: Hp

This is a working demo project for the M5Stack Core 2, using plain ESP IDF and the M5Unified library as the main interface.

Tested on =ESP IDF v4.4.2=, as the =M5Unified= library is not updated on ESP IDF v5 yet.

The library's interface seems to all be working as intended, including: sensors, buttons and graphics.

Notable stuff:

- This has to be included in the main folder's =CMakeLists.txt= if you want to use the M5Unified library. Also your main file needs to be in =.cpp=.
#+begin_src
set(SOURCES main.cpp)
#+end_src

- Freertos tickrate need to be set to 1000 in your =sdkconfig= file. Run =idf.py menuconfig= and set it in Component config -> FreeRTOS -> Tickrate.

- This loop is needed for the library to work as it's intended. Everything that's using the =M5Unified= interface should be in this loop.
#+begin_src cpp
for (;;) {
    vTaskDelay(1);
    M5.update();
}
#+end_src
